        <div class="animal_sq Birds_desc"><a href="birds.html">Birds</a> <!--Hyperlink 1-->
             are warm blooded animals that are special because they have feathers, they can fly, they have bills and their feathers regulate body temperature.
        </div>
        <div class="animal_sq Reptiles_desc"><a href="reptiles.html">Reptiles</a> <!--Hyperlink 2-->
             are air-breathing, cold-blooded vertebrates that have scaly bodies rather than hair or feathers; most reptile species are egg-laying. They include lizards, snakes, turtles, alligators and crocodiles.
        </div>
        <div class="animal_sq Mammals_desc"><a href="mammals.html">Mammals</a> <!--Hyperlink 3-->
             are the class of animals that humans fall under along with other species like cats, dogs and bats. They are mammals because they produce milk that they feed their children, which is the defining factor of if an animal is a mammal or not.
        </div>
        <div class="animal_sq Insects_desc"><a href="Insects.html">Insects</a> <!--Hyperlink 4-->
             are living creatures that have six legs and three body parts, those being the head, the thorax and the abdomen. This is why spiders and scorpions are not actually insects.
        </div>
        <div class="animal_sq Fishes_desc"><a href="Fishes.html">Fishes</a> <!--Hyperlink 5-->
             are a class of aquatic vertebrates.  The combination of gills, fins and the fact that they live only in the water make fish different from all other animals.
        </div>
        <div class="animal_sq Amphibians_desc"><a href="amphibians.html">Amphibians</a> <!--Hyperlink 6-->
             are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin. They are also cold-blooded.
